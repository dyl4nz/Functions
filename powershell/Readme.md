## Introduction

When i was first learning, i found it difficult to remember basic functions and usages of things across different languages, so i have created this repository to document useful functions for many different purposes so that anyone can refer to this to learn or practise.

## Features

The key features of this repository are:
- Oversimplified explanations
- Thorough testing and simplification
- A step by step approach explaining each arguement and why it is there

## Description

In each Unique Function's Folder, there should be the following:
- A readme.md file explaining the purpose, usage and acknowledgements
- The main code block with each line and each arguement explained and neatly seperated
- Any other files that the code block uses
- A duckyscript script that is used to execute the code as quickly as possible, this will also be explained step by step

## Acknowledgements

Many of my functions are from existing codes and payloads created by other creators, if credit is needed, it will be included in each individual function.
